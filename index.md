## Todoist Windows 10 global shortcuts

Since Todoist, its Windows 10 app doesn't support global shortcuts at the moment. I made a small workaround that adds the "open Todoist" and "Add new Todoist task" global shortcuts to Win 10. These workarounds add the following global TODOIST shortcuts to WIN 10:

    - alt+ctrl+a (Add new task)
    - alt+ctrl+s (open Todoist)

For questions, issues and suggestions go to [the github repository issues page](https://github.com/rickstaa/Todoist_Global_Shortcuts_WIN10/issues).
