# How does this workaround work?

A windows 10 universal app can be loaded by using its AppUserModelIDs. This is done by running the following command:



> explorer shell:AppsFolder/AppUserModelID



In this command the "AppUserModelID" refers to the AppUserModelID of the app you want to load. An excellent guide on how to find the AppUserModelID
is located on:



- https://jcutrer.com/howto/windows/find-aumid



When the AppUserModelID is found, it can be used in to create an "AutoHotKey" file. This workaround just automates this process.



# What is the VBS workaround?

This workaround is the first workaround I created it can be used by people that don't like using AutoHotKey. See the README.txt in the TODOIST_VBS folder 
for instructions.
